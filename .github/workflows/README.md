## Nightly Runner Cleanup

The `nightly-runner-cleanup.yml` workflow runs at 4:00 AM PST on self-hosted macOS runner `ci1` to reclaim disk space. It only runs when `RUNNER_NAME == ci1`; other runners skip cleanup.

**Validation (manual run):**

1. Go to Actions → Nightly Runner Cleanup → Run workflow.
2. Confirm the run completes successfully and logs show "Running cleanup on runner: ci1".
3. Check logs for "Disk before" and "Disk after" to verify space reclaimed.
4. On non-ci1 runners, logs should show "Skipping cleanup" and exit successfully.

**Expected behavior:** Deletes only allowlisted paths (npm cache, Playwright browsers, runner \_work dirs older than 2 days, Library/Caches subdirs). Never removes runner binaries, config, or user data outside caches.

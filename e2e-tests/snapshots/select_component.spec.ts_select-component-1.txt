# Tech Stack

- You are building a React application.
- Use TypeScript.
- Use React Router. KEEP the routes in src/App.tsx
- Always put source code in the src folder.
- Put pages into src/pages/
- Put components into src/components/
- The main page (default page) is src/pages/Index.tsx
- UPDATE the main page to include the new components. OTHERWISE, the user can NOT see any components!
- ALWAYS try to use the shadcn/ui library.
- Tailwind CSS: always use Tailwind CSS for styling components. Utilize Tailwind classes extensively for layout, spacing, colors, and other design aspects.

Available packages and libraries:

- The lucide-react package is installed for icons.
- You ALREADY have ALL the shadcn/ui components and their dependencies installed. So you don't need to install them again.
- You have ALL the necessary Radix UI components installed.
- Use prebuilt components from the shadcn/ui library after importing them. Note that these files shouldn't be edited, so make new components if you need to change them.

<theme>
Any instruction in this theme should override other instructions if there's a contradiction.
### Default Theme
<rules>
All the rules are critical and must be strictly followed, otherwise it's a failure state.
#### Core Principles
- This is the default theme used by Dyad users, so it is important to create websites that leave a good impression.
- AESTHETICS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. All web apps should LOOK AMAZING and have GREAT FUNCTIONALITY!
- You are expected to deliver interfaces that balance creativity and functionality.
#### Component Guidelines
- Never ship default shadcn components — every component must be customized in style, spacing, and behavior.
- Always prefer rounded shapes.
#### Typography
- Type should actively shape the interface's character, not fade into neutrality.
#### Color System
- Establish a clear and confident color system.
- Centralize colors through variables to maintain consistency.
- Avoid using gradient backgrounds.
- Avoid using black as the primary color. Aim for colorful websites.
#### Motion & Interaction
- Apply motion with restraint and purpose.
- A small number of carefully composed sequences (like a coordinated entrance with delayed elements) creates more impact than numerous minor effects.
- Motion should clarify structure and intent, not act as decoration.
#### Visual Content
- Visuals are essential: Use images to create mood, context, and appeal.
- Don't build text-only walls.
#### Contrast Guidelines
Never use closely matched colors for an element's background and its foreground content. Insufficient contrast reduces readability and degrades the overall user experience.
**Bad Examples:**
- Light gray text (#B0B0B0) on a white background (#FFFFFF)
- Dark blue text (#1A1A4E) on a black background (#000000)
- Pale yellow button (#FFF9C4) with white text (#FFFFFF)
**Good Examples:**
- Dark charcoal text (#333333) on a white or light gray background
- White or light cream text (#FFFDF5) on a deep navy or dark background (#1A1A2E)
- Vibrant accent button (#6366F1) with white text for clear call-to-action visibility
### Layout structure
- ALWAYS design mobile-first, then enhance for larger screens.
</rules>
<workflow>
Follow this workflow when building web apps:
1. **Determine Design Direction**
   - Analyze the industry and target users of the website.
   - Define colors, fonts, mood, and visual style.
   - Ensure the design direction does NOT contradict the rules defined for this theme.
2. **Build the Application**
   - Do not neglect functionality in the pursuit of making a beautiful website.
   - You must achieve both great aesthetics AND great functionality.
</workflow>
</theme>

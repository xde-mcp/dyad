# Repository Agent Guide

Please read `CONTRIBUTING.md` which includes information for human code contributors. Much of the information is applicable to you as well.

## Rules index

> **IMPORTANT: BEFORE writing any code or making changes, you MUST read the relevant rule files from the table below.** Identify which areas your task touches and read those rule files first. Skipping this step leads to avoidable mistakes and rework.

Detailed rules and learnings are in the `rules/` directory. Read the relevant file when working in that area.

## Project setup and lints

Make sure you run this once after doing `npm install` because it will make sure whenever you commit something, it will run pre-commit hooks like linting and formatting.

```sh
npm run init-precommit
```

**Note:** Running `npm install` may update `package-lock.json` with version changes or peer dependency flag removals. If rebasing or performing git operations, commit these changes first to avoid "unstaged changes" errors.

## Pre-commit checks

RUN THE FOLLOWING CHECKS before you do a commit.

If you have access to the `/dyad:lint` skill, use it to run all pre-commit checks automatically:

```
/dyad:lint
```

Otherwise, run the following commands directly:

**Formatting**

```sh
npm run fmt
```

**Linting**

```sh
npm run lint
```

If you get any lint errors, you can usually fix it by doing:

```sh
npm run lint:fix
```

**Type-checks**

```sh
npm run ts
```

Note: if you do this, then you will need to re-add the changes and commit again.

## Running TypeScript

> **WARNING: Do NOT run `npx tsc` or `tsc` directly.** The project is not set up for direct `tsc` invocation and will produce incorrect or misleading results.

**Always use:**

```sh
npm run ts
```

This is the only supported way to type-check the project. It uses the correct configuration and compiler (`tsgo`). Any other method of running TypeScript checks is unsupported and will likely give wrong results.

## Project context

- This is an Electron application with a secure IPC boundary.
- Frontend is a React app that uses TanStack Router (not Next.js or React Router).
- Data fetching/mutations should be handled with TanStack Query when touching IPC-backed endpoints.

## General guidance

- Favor descriptive module/function names that mirror IPC channel semantics.
- Keep Electron security practices in mind (no `remote`, validate/lock by `appId` when mutating shared resources).
- Add tests in the same folder tree when touching renderer components.

Use these guidelines whenever you work within this repository.

## Testing

Our project relies on a combination of unit testing and E2E testing. Unless your change is trivial, you MUST add a test, preferably an e2e test case.

### Unit testing

Use unit testing for pure business logic and util functions.

### E2E testing

> **IMPORTANT: You MUST run `npm run build` before running E2E tests.** E2E tests run against the built application, not the dev server. If you have changed any application code (i.e. anything outside of test files), you MUST re-run `npm run build` before running the tests, otherwise the tests will run against stale code and results will be misleading. Only changes to test code itself (e.g. files in `e2e-tests/`) do not require a rebuild.

See [rules/e2e-testing.md](rules/e2e-testing.md) for full E2E testing guidance, including Playwright tips and fixture setup.

**Debugging E2E test failures with screenshots:** When an E2E test fails and you can't determine the cause from the error message alone, use the `/dyad:debug-with-playwright` skill to add screenshots at key points in the test. Playwright's built-in `screenshot: "on"` does NOT work with Electron — you must use manual `page.screenshot()` calls. The skill walks you through adding debug screenshots, running the test, viewing the captured PNGs, and cleaning up afterward.

## Git workflow

When pushing changes and creating PRs:

1. If the branch already has an associated PR, push to whichever remote the branch is tracking.
2. If the branch hasn't been pushed before, default to pushing to `origin` (the fork `wwwillchen/dyad`), then create a PR from the fork to the upstream repo (`dyad-sh/dyad`).
3. If you cannot push to the fork due to permissions, push directly to `upstream` (`dyad-sh/dyad`) as a last resort.

### Skipping automated review

Add `#skip-bugbot` to the PR description for trivial PRs that won't affect end-users, such as:

- Claude settings, commands, or agent configuration
- Linting or test setup changes
- Documentation-only changes
- CI/build configuration updates
